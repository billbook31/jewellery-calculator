  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We value your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.</p>
  <p><strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> Bill details and shop information that you enter are stored locally in your browser's local storage. This data remains on your device and is not sent to our servers unless you perform an action that requires it (like saving a bill, which sends anonymized data for analytics).</p>
  <p><strong>Data Shared with Firebase:</strong> To improve our services and provide features like an admin dashboard and a dynamic blog, we use Google Firebase. The following anonymous or non-personally identifiable information is sent to Firebase:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Usage analytics, such as page visits, button clicks (e.g., "WhatsApp Share", "Shop Registered"), and total bill values for statistical purposes.</li>
    <li>Blog content, which is managed by the site administrator.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not store personal details like customer names or contact numbers in our database. The admin login is handled securely by Firebase Authentication.</p>
  <p>If we make changes to this policy, they will be updated on this page.</p>
  <p>For any concerns, please write to: <a href="mailto:billbook31@gmail.com">billbook31@gmail.com</a></p>
